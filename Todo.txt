Todo:
* Decouple velocity in body a bit more from the rest of the system

Done:
* Research polygon, and change update method so that it moves the shape relative to the center
* Check over coordinate class
* Link environment to scene
* Debug rules and properly implement scene scaling so they don't go stupid fast
* Fix angling and tone down distancing
* fix where adding the first one doesn't appear
